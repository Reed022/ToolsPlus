# ToolsPlus

Tools+ is a simple Spigot plugin with an aim to recreate the Tinker's Construct mod in a very simple plugin form. 
### Features:
- Tools: Tools+ provides simple crafting recipes for each of the tools. Tools+ tools have several properties that set them apart from vanilla tools...
- Tool Leveling: Each Tools+ tool has its own level. Tools gain leveling exp by being used. When a tool levels up, it gains a modifier slot, allowing the player to customize their tool further.
- Modifiers: Instead of using Minecraft's traditional enchanting system, Tools+ uses something similar to TC: Modifiers. Each modifier has a corresponding item (such as redstone for efficiency). The tool is infused with a set number of that item (depending on the tool type and modifier level) to progress to the next modifier level. Starting progress on a modifier level takes up a modifier slot. 
- Repairs: Tools+ tools never permanently break. They can always be repaired using the corresponding material's repair kit. This will cost 10exp levels per repair, but fully repairs the tool.
- Upgrading: Tools can be upgraded to the next tier while retaining their modifiers, modifier slots, and level. By default, upgrading your tool's material will also grant it an extra modifier slot. Additionally, the upgraded tool will be fully repaired. Upgrading tools gets progressively more expensive with higher-tier materials.
- Toolsmith Table: The toolsmith table is the Tools+ custom workbench used for modifications, repairs, and upgrades of Tools+ tools. It is a simple workstation similar to the smithing table: Two input slots, a "Modify" button, and an output slot.
